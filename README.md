About Institute Student Portal (ISP)
ISP is a web-based application software designed to introduce a conducive and structured information exchange environment for integrating students, teachers and the administration of a school or college.
Project Scope
The scope of the Student Information System includes the following functionality.
Registration
Manage all data and business processes associated with Admissions and its constituencies: students, courses, course coordinators, faculties. In addition to an efficient and effective means to manage constituency data, the system will provide a portal for prospects to update their information, a portal for students to see updated notification and online application reading through a document.
Course Management
Add, approve, and maintain course data, including prerequisites and co-requisites, titles, descriptions. Moving forward, track course offerings by course and extract the data required to generate the Institute Catalogue.
Curriculum Planning
In the future, as course requirements are added to the system, use potential/future course demand data to enhance curriculum planning as well. Provide online capability for adding and dropping courses at the beginning of each semester.
Scheduling
Create and maintain course offerings. Each offering includes the instructor(s), section information in addition to lectures.
Student Records Management
Maintain students' biographical, status, and academic information in a secure, accessible system.

Grading
Provide a secure online system for faculty to enter final semester grades for each student. 
Student, Faculty, and Staff portal tools
Provide online tools for managing biographical information, submitting administrative requests, viewing and/or updating electronic notes and grades, and completing academic planning.
